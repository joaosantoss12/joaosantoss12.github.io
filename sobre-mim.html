      My name is Ruben Vale I am 25 years old and I am Portuguese<br />I am

        Let me tell you a little bit of my story so you can know me better and
        be a part of this journey that I am building. I always liked to play
        Counter Strike and it was in the Cyber Cafes in 2008 that I tried the
        game when version 1.6 came out and that gave me that taste to start
        playing at home in my computer. As the years went by and Counter Strike
        evolved, I installed Counter Strike Global Offensive on January 2nd,
        2016 and have been having fun and evolving with friends. It should be
        noted and to kill your curiosity that my first rank was silver 4 :)<br /><br />
        Then on February 15th, 2019, at the insistence of my friends I did my
        first livestream, but it was just for fun, and I never assumed that I
        would reach the stage I am today. What is certain is that I have been a
        streamer for 3 years now on Twitch and I already have my channel
        verified. I have about 35,000 followers which I am very proud of and the
        community I have and continue to build day after day. After reaching max
        level on faceit on April 8th, 2019, I started playing with some of the
        big names in Portuguese and international Counter Strike, as well as
        achieving some achievements.<br /><br />
        As time went by I received an offer to officially play for a semi
        professional team where for 6 months i played on the Golden Gaming team
        where we also participated in some national and international
        tournaments throughout the year of 2019.<br /><br />
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="middle-text-um">
      My stream was evolving slowly and slowly achieving some of the goals I set
      and never thinking about getting the statistics that I have today.<br />
    </div>
    <div class="middle-text">
      <br />In 2020 I made streams playing some open qualifiers on Faceit's
      platform and on January 11th, 2020, in the open qualifier I face nothing
      less than the old Giants team in the quarterfinals of the Counter Strike
      Professional League (LPCS), losing the game to a 16-2 on the map de_dust2
      in which we only put the pistol attacking in the first half.<br /><br />
      I participated in the LAN HOUSE Penafiel on February 29th, 2020, where in
      the semi final we won after losing the first map and in the second map we
      were losing by 14-5 attacking in de_nuke we went to overtime and won that
      game in the de_nuke map. We went to the third decider map and it was the
      overpass map where we won on overtime the decider. We took to the final a
      BO3 game where we won by 2-0 in maps.<br /><br />
      On November 4th, 2021, I played the qualifier for Omen Retake playing
      against the professional team called Offset losing the game 16-12. I can
      say that it was a hard game and made me want to learn more and more.<br /><br />
      It should be noted that all these games were always played with teammates.
      No longer represented by the team previously mentioned.<br /><br />

      Besides being a streamer, I am also a soccer player.<br />

      <div class="segundo-texto">
        I started in soccer at the age of 6 where I played for 4 years for
        Futebol Clube do Porto, where I was coached by Pepijn Lijnders,
        currently JÃ¼rgen Klopp's assistant at FC Liverpool.<br /><br />
        At the age of 10 I moved to PaÃƒÂ§os de Ferreira until I was 15.<br /><br />
        At 17 I played for Futebol Clube do Sobrado, where I achieved some
        achievements and played the whole season in the senior team only playing
        1 game in the whole championship.<br /><br />
        At 18 I played in Sport ComÃ©rcio e Salgueiros for the senior team.<br /><br />
        At the age of 19 I managed to play in the Portuguese championship (3rd
        league) for UniÃƒÂ£o Sport Clube Paredes but at the age of 20 I decided to
        return to the place where I always felt good and continued my journey in
        Sobrado. <br /><br />
        I find myself playing for Sporting Clube Paivense where in the 2021/2022
        season I became champion of the series of my division, and I was second
        in the promotion phase where Sport Clube Beira-Mar was champion and thus
        went up the division.<br />
        Now I am playing for the FC Alpendorada team during the 2022/2023
        season.
